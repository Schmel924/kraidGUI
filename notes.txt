Todo:
	Find a utf-8 library to use and include it into the project
		https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/awesompd/blob/master/utf8.lua ?
        
    Multi-Line text output
    Get BoundingBox of Children
    Drag&Drop for TreeView

    Docs: Repeat everything you need to know in "Add a theme" and "Add a widget" and don't require reading the introduction

	Build a window with a scrollbar (maybe as a subclass even)
		-> getChildrenDimension ("Think about")
        
	Image-functionality in backend
	Cursor-support in backend
	Mutliple font support

Think about:
	For showing/hiding scrollbars widgets should be able to determine a bounding box of their children
	Some things have to be handled in theme.update, but they shouldn't. Maybe have the possibility for setters to be called for themes?
	Should vertical and horizontal scrollbars be different classes? (I think so, but I'm too lazy)
