Todo:
	Find a utf-8 library to use and include it into the project
		https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/awesompd/blob/master/utf8.lua ?

	Write documentation
		For expanding:
			Example application for a simple widget (-> main.lua)
			How to add a new widget
				in theme + a new file in widgets.lua and also outline how to do it from the outside
				also how you can add a new theme, using any library function you want
			Outline the general flow of events and information, children, rect-parameters and canvases and coordinate systems
			modules
		For using:
			how to create widgets: pass named arguments, unsure about the order (because of pairs) -> only set parameters that are independent
				otherwise: multiple calls to setParam, which should also be used as often as possible
			setDefaultParameter
			theme as property

	Build a window with a scrollbar (maybe as a subclass even)
		-> getChildrenDimension ("Think about")
	Image-functionality in backend
	Cursor-support in backend
	Mutliple font support

Think about:
	For showing/hiding scrollbars widgets should be able to determine a bounding box of their children
	Some things have to be handled in theme.update, but they shouldn't. Maybe have the possibility for setters to be called for themes?
	Should vertical and horizontal scrollbars be different classes? (I think so, but I'm too lazy)

Bugs:
	pass
